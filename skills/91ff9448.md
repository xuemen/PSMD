# Skill: 91ff9448 - Regulatory Compliance Infrastructure

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Skill ID**: 91ff9448
**Category**: Regulatory Framework
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-10

## 1. Description

This skill defines requirements for establishing and maintaining a regulatory compliance infrastructure. The infrastructure must ensure that written rules have违约成本 (breach costs) that exceed benefits, while minimizing resource burden on non-regulatory personnel and external partners. Agents must validate that compliance systems meet these fundamental economic incentive requirements.

## 4. Error Patterns (Auto-Detection)

### 4.1 Missing Cost-Benefit Analysis Pattern
```
Pattern: Compliance infrastructure without cost-benefit analysis
Detection Rule:
  - Check if 'enforcement_cost_benefit_analysis' exists
  - Verify 'cost_exceeds_benefit' boolean is set
  - Confirm analysis has quantitative or qualitative basis
Natural Language Detection:
  "This compliance infrastructure lacks a cost-benefit analysis showing
   that breach costs exceed benefits. Please provide quantitative or
   qualitative evidence that violating rules is more costly than
   following them."
Response: CLARIFY
```

### 4.2 Excessive Resource Burden Pattern
```
Pattern: Infrastructure imposes significant burden on non-regulatory personnel
Detection Rule:
  - Check 'resource_burden_statement.internal_non_oversight_burden'
  - Flag if status is 'significant' without mitigation measures
  - Check 'external_party_burden' for excessive requirements
Natural Language Detection:
  "This infrastructure imposes significant resource burden on personnel
   not involved in oversight. Please provide mitigation measures or
   demonstrate why the burden is necessary."
Response: CLARIFY
```

### 4.3 Missing Enforcement Mechanism Pattern
```
Pattern: Infrastructure without formal enforcement capability
Detection Rule:
  - Verify 'has_enforcement_mechanism' is true
  - Check if compliance_verification_methods are defined
  - Validate that verification leads to consequences
Natural Language Detection:
  "A compliance infrastructure without enforcement mechanisms cannot
   ensure breach costs exceed benefits. Please define how violations
   will be detected and addressed."
Response: CLARIFY
```

### 4.4 Missing Foundation Pattern
```
Pattern: Infrastructure lacks basic systems and personnel
Detection Rule:
  - Verify 'has_basic_systems' is true
  - Check 'has_oversight_personnel' is true
  - Confirm systems can actually enforce rules
Natural Language Detection:
  "Compliance infrastructure requires foundational systems and personnel
   to function. Please establish basic enforcement capabilities before
   proceeding."
Response: CLARIFY
```

## 5. Prompt Templates

[ ] External partners not unduly burdened

Please provide:
1. Evidence that breach costs exceed benefits
2. Description of enforcement mechanisms
3. Resource burden assessment for all stakeholder categories
4. Any mitigation measures for identified burdens
```

### 5.2 Compliance Validation Template
```
Validating compliance infrastructure: {infrastructure_id}

Cost-Benefit Analysis:
- Breach Cost Estimate: {breach_cost}
- Benefit Estimate: {benefit}
- Cost Exceeds Benefit: {cost_exceeds_benefit}

Resource Burden:
- Internal Non-Oversight: {internal_burden}
- External Partners: {external_burden}

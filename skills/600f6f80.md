# Skill: 600f6f80 - Regulatory Justification Requirements

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Skill ID**: 600f6f80
**Category**: Regulatory Compliance
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-10

## 1. Description

This skill establishes requirements for justifying regulatory proposals and responding to inquiries. When establishing regulations, the proponent must clearly state expected effects and be prepared to provide justification using either external law or statistical case evidence. This skill also defines rules for handling cross-branch evidence and scope limitations for rule revisions.

## 4. Error Patterns (Auto-Detection)

### 4.1 Missing Expected Effects Pattern
```
Pattern: Regulatory proposal without clearly stated expected effects
Detection Rule:
  - Check 'regulatory_proposal.expected_effects' is not empty
  - Verify each expected effect has clear description
  - Flag vague or missing effect statements
Natural Language Detection:
  "This regulatory proposal must clearly state all expected effects.
   Please provide specific, measurable outcomes this regulation aims to achieve."
Response: CLARIFY
```

### 4.2 Missing Justification Pattern
```
Pattern: Proposal without required justification upon inquiry
Detection Rule:
  - Check 'justification_response' exists when inquiry is made
  - Verify 'justification_basis' is specified
  - Confirm supporting evidence is provided
Natural Language Detection:
  "Upon inquiry, you must provide justification using either external
   law or case statistics. Please specify your justification basis
   and provide supporting evidence."
Response: CLARIFY
```

### 4.3 Invalid Justification Basis Pattern
```
Pattern: Justification basis is neither external law nor case statistics
Detection Rule:
  - Check 'justification_response.justification_basis' is valid enum
  - Verify corresponding evidence structure is complete
  - Flag unsupported justification types
Natural Language Detection:
  "Justification must be based on either external law or case statistics.
   Please provide one of these two valid justification types with supporting evidence."
Response: CLARIFY
```

### 4.4 Cross-Branch Evidence Without Motion Pattern
```
Pattern: Evidence from other branch without triggered switching motion
Detection Rule:
  - If 'cross_branch_evidence.evidence_from_other_branch' is true:
    - Verify 'automatic_motion_triggered' is true
    - Check 'motion_status' is appropriately tracked
Natural Language Detection:
  "Using evidence from another branch automatically triggers a motion to
   switch to that branch's regulations. Please acknowledge this motion
   and address it before proceeding."
Response: CLARIFY
```

### 4.5 Revision Scope Limitation Violation Pattern
```
Pattern: Revision notification sent to entities outside scope
Detection Rule:
  - If 'revision_scope.is_revision' is true:
    - Verify 'notification_scope' matches 'applicability_scope'
    - Confirm entities outside scope are not notified
Natural Language Detection:
  "Revision notifications should only be sent to entities within the
   revision's applicability scope. Please adjust your notification list."
Response: CLARIFY
```

## 5. Prompt Templates

### 5.1 Proposal Submission Template
```
Submitting regulatory proposal: {proposal_title}

Required Information:
1. Expected Effects: List all outcomes this regulation aims to achieve
   - Be specific and measurable
   - Prioritize primary effects

2. Justification Basis (for inquiry response):
   - External Law: Cite specific legal provisions
   - Case Statistics: Provide statistical evidence with methodology

3. Scope Information:
   - If revision: Specify original regulation and scope of changes
   - Define applicability scope for notifications

4. Branch Context:
   - If using evidence from another branch, motion to switch may be triggered
   - Confirm awareness of cross-branch implications
```

### 5.2 Justification Response Template
```
Responding to inquiry about: {proposal_title}

Justification Basis: {basis_type}

External Law Reference:
- Law: {law_id}
- Jurisdiction: {jurisdiction}
- Provision: {provision_reference}
- Binding Effect: {binding_level}

OR Case Statistics:

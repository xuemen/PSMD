# Skill: 9e6bc34f - Information Disclosure Standards

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Skill ID**: 9e6bc34f

## 1. Description

This skill defines standards for information disclosure, emphasizing that all work products default to public disclosure. It establishes rules for navigating between disclosure requirements and confidentiality regimes, ensuring that secrecy provisions cannot be used to hide negligence or circumvent accountability. The key principle is that information cannot be selectively hidden at different stages of its lifecycle.

## 4. Error Patterns (Auto-Detection)

### 4.1 Non-Default Disclosure Pattern
```
Pattern: Document not marked as public by default
Detection Rule:
  - Check 'disclosure_status' is not 'public'
  - Verify explicit justification for non-public status
  - Confirm disclosure rules in chain allow restriction
Natural Language Detection:
  "This document is not marked for public disclosure. Please provide
   explicit justification for the restricted status and confirm the
   confidentiality rule is properly positioned in the hierarchy."
Response: CLARIFY
```

### 4.2 Inconsistent Disclosure Method Pattern
```
Pattern: Document obtained through different methods at different stages
Detection Rule:
  - Compare 'disclosure_method' with lifecycle documentation
  - Check for method changes without force majeure justification
  - Flag if source_location changes during lifecycle
Natural Language Detection:
  "The disclosure method changed during the document lifecycle. Please
   provide force majeure justification and the determination procedure
   for this change."
Response: CLARIFY
```

### 4.3 Confidentiality Rule Hierarchy Violation Pattern
```
Pattern: Confidentiality rule improperly placed in hierarchy
Detection Rule:
  - Validate position of confidentiality rules in 'disclosure_chain'
  - Flag confidentiality rules at same or higher level than disclosure rules
  - Check if top-level rules would be improperly restricted
Natural Language Detection:
  "A confidentiality rule is improperly positioned in the hierarchy
   and could override top-level disclosure rules. Please restructure
   the confidentiality provisions to respect the hierarchy."
Response: CLARIFY
```

### 4.4 Unaddressed Capability Gap Pattern
```
Pattern: Personnel without capability to fulfill requirements, no responsibility assigned
Detection Rule:
  - Check 'capability_assessment.assessment_result'
  - If 'incapable', verify 'responsible_party' is specified
  - Flag unaddressed capability gaps
Natural Language Detection:
  "Personnel lacking capability to complete this task have been identified,
   but no responsible party has been assigned. Those who established the
   confidentiality requirements bear responsibility for any resulting losses."
Response: CLARIFY
```

### 4.5 Missing Source Location Pattern
```
Pattern: Document without verifiable source location
Detection Rule:
  - Verify 'source_location' is a valid, accessible URI
  - Confirm content_hash matches source document
  - Flag if source cannot be independently verified
Natural Language Detection:
  "A verifiable source location is required for this document. Please
   provide the original publication URI where this document can be
   independently accessed and verified."
Response: CLARIFY
```

## 5. Prompt Templates

### 5.1 Disclosure Assessment Template
```
Assessing disclosure standards for: {document_title}

Default Disclosure Principle:
All work products default to public disclosure. If this document is
restricted, you must justify the restriction.

Disclosure Chain Requirements:
1. Identify all rules affecting disclosure level
2. Trace from top-level rules down to confidentiality provisions
3. Verify confidentiality rules are subordinate to disclosure rules

Disclosure Method:
- How was this document originally obtained?
- Has the method changed at any stage?
- If changed, what force majeure justified the change?

Capability Assessment:
- Can personnel subject to this rule complete the required tasks?
- If not, who bears responsibility?

Please provide complete chain documentation with justifications.
```

### 5.2 Disclosure Validation Template
```
Validating disclosure compliance for: {disclosure_id}

Document: {document_title}
Status: {disclosure_status}
Method: {disclosure_method}
Source: {source_location}

Default Disclosure Check:
[ ] Document is public by default OR justified restriction exists
[ ] Confidentiality rules are subordinate to disclosure rules
[ ] No rule in chain would improperly restrict top-level rules

Method Consistency Check:
[ ] Same method used throughout lifecycle OR force majeure justified
[ ] Force majeure determination procedure was followed

Capability Check:
[ ] Capable personnel identified OR responsibility assigned

DECISION: {COMPLIANT|IGNORE|CLARIFY}
Findings: {findings_json}
```

# Skill: dbe32f79 - Behavioral Verification Methods

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Skill ID**: dbe32f79
**Category**: Verification
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-10

---

## 1. Description

This skill defines methods for verifying past behaviors when accountability is required. When behavior verification is needed, one of three valid methods must be used: (1) complete, continuous, immutable records; (2) self-statements from all involved parties with cross-verification; or (3) guarantor-appointed verification with published findings. Agents must ensure verification methods meet the required standards for completeness and reliability.

## 4. Error Patterns (Auto-Detection)

### 4.1 No Verification Method Selected Pattern
```
Pattern: Verification request without selected method
Detection Rule:
  - Check 'verification_method' is specified
  - Verify corresponding evidence structure is populated
  - Flag incomplete verification requests
Natural Language Detection:
  "Please select a verification method: (1) complete records, (2) self-statements
   with cross-verification, or (3) guarantor verification. Provide evidence for
   the selected method."
Response: CLARIFY
```

### 4.2 Incomplete Records Pattern
```
Pattern: Records verification with gaps or without immutability
Detection Rule:
  - If 'complete_records_evidence.has_complete_records' is true:
    - Verify 'continuous_coverage' is true
    - Check 'is_immutable' is true
    - Flag if gaps exist in coverage
Natural Language Detection:
  "Complete records must provide continuous coverage with no gaps and
   demonstrate immutability. Please address any gaps or provide a
   different verification method."
Response: CLARIFY
```

### 4.3 Self-Statement Incomplete Pattern
```
Pattern: Self-statement verification with missing elements
Detection Rule:
  - If 'self_statement_evidence.has_self_statements' is true:
    - Check all involved parties provided statements
    - Verify each party received all other statements
    - Confirm opinions on other statements are provided
Natural Language Detection:
  "Self-statement verification requires: (1) statements from ALL involved
   parties, (2) each party received ALL other statements, and (3) each
   party provided opinions on others' statements."
Response: CLARIFY
```

### 4.4 Guarantor Not Agreed Pattern
```
Pattern: Guarantor verification without universal agreement
Detection Rule:
  - If 'guarantor_verification.has_guarantor_verification' is true:
    - Check 'all_parties_agreed' is true
    - Verify guarantor duties are specified
    - Flag unagreed guarantor selections
Natural Language Detection:
  "Guarantor verification requires agreement from ALL involved parties.
   Please confirm universal agreement or select an alternative method."
Response: CLARIFY
```

### 4.5 Guarantor Duties Incomplete Pattern
```
Pattern: Guarantor verification with incomplete duty specification
Detection Rule:
  - If guarantor selected:
    - Verify 'will_publish_records' is true
    - Check 'will_organize_recall_session' is true
    - Confirm 'will_provide_report' is true
    - Flag missing guarantor duties
Natural Language Detection:
  "Guarantor must commit to: (1) publishing records using Method 1 or 2,
   (2) organizing recall sessions for cross-verification, and (3) providing
   a final report."
Response: CLARIFY
```

## 5. Prompt Templates

### 5.1 Verification Request Template
```
Requesting behavior verification for event: {event_description}

Involved Parties:
{list_of_parties}

Purpose: {verification_purpose}

Please select ONE verification method:

METHOD 1: Complete Records
- Do you have complete, continuous, immutable records?
- What record types are available?
- Is coverage continuous with no gaps?
- How is immutability ensured?
- Where are records stored?

METHOD 2: Self-Statements
- Will all parties provide self-statements?
- Can each party receive all other statements?
- Will each party provide opinions on others' statements?

METHOD 3: Guarantor Verification
- Have all parties agreed on a guarantor?
- What are the guarantor's qualifications?
- Will guarantor publish records (Method 1 or 2)?
- Will guarantor organize recall sessions?
- Will guarantor provide a report?
```

### 5.2 Self-Statement Collection Template
```
Collecting self-statements for verification:

Each involved party must provide:
1. A complete statement describing their perspective
2. The statement format (written/verbal/video)
3. Timestamp of when statement was made

After all statements are collected:
- Each party must receive ALL other parties' statements
- Each party must provide opinions on EACH other statement
- Opinions can be: agree, disagree, partially agree, or request clarification

Statement Status:
{party}: {submitted|pending}
Opinion Status:
{party} on {other_party}: {submitted|pending}
```
